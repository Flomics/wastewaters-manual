Welcome to SARS-CoV-2 waste waters analysis pipeline's documentation!
===================================================

Flomicsâ€™ **SARS-CoV-2 waste waters Data analysis pipeline** was developed to produce interpretable results from waste waters sequencing NGS-based experiments where SARS-CoV-2 is the target, without the need to learn bioinformatics. 

The user will obtain from raw, unprocessed sequencing files curated outputs such as lineage characterization of the sample. The pipeline accepts Illumina data (single-end or paired-end reads) obtained using various kits, with new kits being added as they become available. Support for PacBio and IonTorrent sequencing data is experimental at this point.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
