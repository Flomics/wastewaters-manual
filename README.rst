Read The Docs Waste Waters pipeline manual
=======================================

This GitHub repo hosts the code to build the RTD manual of the WW pipeline.

Read the manual here:

https://wastewaters-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

In general, files outside `docs/source/` should not be modified if one wants to modify the contents of the manual. The files outside that folder have to do with the building process of the the RTD page, and thus only modified when knowing what is being done.
